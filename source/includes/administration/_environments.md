## Environments

Environments allow you to manage resources of a specific service and to manage your [users'](#administration-users) access to them. With [environment roles](#administration-roles), you have tight control of what a user is allowed to do in your environment. A general use case of environments is to split your resources into different [deployment environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment) (e.g. dev, staging and production). The advantage is that resources of different deployments are isolated from each other and you can restrict user access to your most critical resources.

### Create environment

Environments are created asynchronously to the underlying service. When creating an environment any underlying actions performed by the plugin is done asynchronously to the creation of the model, and its progress is reflected in the state of the environment. 


`POST /environments`

```shell
# Create an environment

curl -X POST "https://cloudmc_endpoint/v1/environments" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key" \
   -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
