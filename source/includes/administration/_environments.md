## Environments

Environments allow you to manage resources of a specific service and to manage your [users'](#administration-users) access to them. With [environment roles](#administration-roles), you have tight control of what a user is allowed to do in your environment. A general use case of environments is to split your resources into different [deployment environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment) (e.g. dev, staging and production). The advantage is that resources of different deployments are isolated from each other and you can restrict user access to your most critical resources.
