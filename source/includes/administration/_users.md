## Users

A user account allows users to authenticate to an [organization](#administration-organizations) and to have access to the resources in it. You can restrict user access to the system and environments by assigning them specific [roles](#administration-roles). Additionally, every user is given an API key which is needed to use our APIs. All operations done by users are persisted and can be accessed through the activity log.

<!-------------------- LIST USERS -------------------->

### List users

`GET /users`

```shell
# Retrieve visible users

curl "https://cloudmc_endpoint/api/v1/users" \
   -H "MC-Api-Key: your_api_key"
```
> The above command returns a JSON structured like this:
