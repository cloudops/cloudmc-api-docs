#### Load balancer

HTTP(S) load balancing can balance HTTP and HTTPS traffic across multiple backend instances, across multiple regions. Your entire app is available via a single global IP address, resulting in a simplified DNS setup. HTTP(S) load balancing is scalable, fault-tolerant, requires no pre-warming, and enables content-based load balancing. For HTTPS traffic, it provides SSL termination and load balancing.
